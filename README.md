# `macaroni`

Macro spaghetti code.

(A macaron is a little syntax sugar sandwich.)

This is an experimental alternative to `defmacro`. This proof-of-concept is implemented in [Janet](https://janet-lang.org), but the technique could work in any language with a similar macro system.

A macaron is a generalization of a regular macro, with three differences:

- A macro can only appear at the beginning of a form. A macaron can appear anywhere inside a form.
- Macarons are first-class values, and macarons can return other macarons. This allows macarons to not only rewrite themselves, but also the forms in which they appear.
- Macarons are dynamically scoped, so you can have macarons define private helper macarons for to use while expanding their arguments. (not yet implemented in any useful form)

Macarons have two argument lists: the arguments "to the left" of the macro, and the arguments "to the right." For example, a macaron called `foo` would receive the following arguments if it appeared in the following positions:

```janet
(foo x y) # [] ['x 'y]
(x foo y) # ['x] ['y]
(x y foo) # ['x 'y] []
```

This is a generalization of a regular macro, since a macaron that checks that there are no nodes to the left of it is exactly a traditional `defmacro` macro.

# operator sections

For a simple example of something you can do with a macaron that you cannot do with a regular macro, consider [operator sections](http://wiki.haskell.org/Section_of_an_infix_operator). In this example, `+`, `-`, and `>` have been redefined as macarons:

```
repl:1:> (1 + 2)
3
repl:2:> (def plus-one (+ 1))
<function 0x6000026A8080>
repl:3:> (plus-one 10)
11
repl:4:> (map (+ 1) [1 2 3])
(2 3 4)
repl:5:> (map (1 -) [0.2 0.5 0.6])
(0.8 0.5 0.4)
repl:5:> (all (> 0) [1 2 3])
true
```

We can define such a "partially-applicable" macaron like this:

```janet
(defmacaron + [& left] [& right]
  (case [(length left) (length right)]
    [0 0] (error "nothing to add")
    [1 0] (with-syms [$] ~(fn [,$] (,+ ,(first left) ,$)))
    [0 1] (with-syms [$] ~(fn [,$] (,+ ,$ ,(first right))))
    [1 1] ~(,+ ,(first left) ,(first right))
    (error "too many arguments")))
```

Now you might be thinking: why? We can just write `|(+ $ 1)` and get exactly the same effect. Which is very true: operator sections aren't a compelling addition to Janet's syntax.

# infix application

Here's a weirder one. Consider the following Janet code:

```janet
(x | f)
```

That will parse into the following abstract syntax tree:

```janet
(x (short-fn f))
```

But let's say we want to make `|` behave as in [Bauble's postfix function application](https://bauble.studio), where `(x | f)` becomes `(f x)`.

We can do this by defining a macaron called `short-fn` that rewrites that expression.

Of course, we could also define a *macro* called `short-fn` -- it is a macro in the standard library, after all. But a macro would only be able to replace the form `(short-fn f)` with a new form. A macaron can actually replace the *parent form* that the `short-fn` appears in.

It does this by returning not an abstract syntax tree, but a first-class macaron. That macaron will be expanded -- just like any other macaron -- in the position it appears in its parent's form. So it's a two-step process:

```janet
(x (short-fn f))
(x <macaron>)
(f x)
```

Where did the `f` go? It was smuggled into the parent in the closure of the anonymous macaron's environment. Here, let's look at a slightly simpler example first:

```janet
(defmacaron short-fn [] [form]
  (macaron [& before] [& after]
    [;before 'pipe form ;after]))
```

That will go through the following expansions:

```janet
(x (short-fn f))
(x <macaron>)
(x pipe f)
```

We could then define a macaron called `pipe`, if we wanted to, to do the actual rearranging. But in reality, we can just return another first-class macaron directly:

```janet
(def pipe (macaron [& before] [& after]
  (def subject (case (length before)
    0 (error "nothing to pipe!")
    1 (first before)
    before))

  (match after
    [f & args] [f subject ;args]
    [] (error "nothing to pipe!"))))

(defmacaron short-fn [] [form]
  (macaron [& before] [& after]
    [;before pipe form ;after]))
```

I find this syntax very useful, and I'm very pleased by how easy it is to implement as a macaron. From the tests, some examples of what this macaron does:

```janet
(test-macaroni (x | f)
  (f x))

(test-macaroni (x 1 | f)
  (f (x 1)))

(test-macaroni (x 1 | f 2 3 | g 4)
  (g (f (x 1) 2 3) 4))
```

This is a lot like the threading macro `->`, but it's easier for me to read and write.

# `def`

The original motivating use-case for macaroni was `def`.

Janet has `def` of course, so this sounds ridiculous. But you don't *need* `def` as a language primitive. You can implement `def` in terms of `let` pretty easily, like this:

```janet
(defmacaron def [] [name value]
  (macaron [& lefts] [& rights]
    ~(,;lefts (let [,name ,value] ,;rights))))

(test-macaroni (do (def x 1) (+ x 1))
  (do
    (let
      [x 1]
      (+ x 1))))
```

Once again, the expansion goes like this:

```janet
(do (def x 1) (+ x 1))
(do <macaron> (+ x 1))
(do (let [x 1] (+ x 1)))
```

(And, of course, you can implement `let` in terms of `lambda`. And you can also implement `do` in terms of lambda, and have an incredibly small set of special forms. But... now is not the time for that. In Janet, `do` and `def` are special-forms, and `let` is actually implemented in terms of them. Which is perfectly pragmatic, but wouldn't you rather have a bizarre lambda calculus core surrounded by macro spaghetti?)

# `defer`

Another thing you can do with this is a `defer` "statement" that does not increase indentation:

```janet
(do
  (def f (file/open "file"))
  (defer (file/close f))
  (do-something)
  (do-something-else))
```

By rewriting that to a `finally`:

```janet
(defmacaron defer [] [expr]
  (macaron [& lefts] [& rights]
    ~(,;lefts (finally (do ,;rights) ,expr))))

(test-macaroni
  (do
    (def f (file/open "foo.txt"))
    (defer (file/close f))
    (do-something)
    (do-something-else))
  (do
    (def f (file/open "foo.txt"))
    (finally
      (do
        (do-something)
        (do-something-else)) 
      (file/close f))))
```

(Janet doesn't actually have a `finally` macro in the standard library, but that's easy to define as a regular macro.)

The Gleam language [special-cases this kind of construct](https://gleam.run/book/tour/use.html) in a general way, which is neat. But with macarons, there is no need for any kind of special-case.

# Infix operators

There is [a simple example in the tests](test/infix.janet) of implementing left- and right-associative infix operators, as well as operators with two levels of precedence.

I *think* it's possible to implement arbitrary precedence infix operators with this technique, but I haven't attempted it yet.
